### Credit

I made this repo for the pure simple reason that I needed to be able to access my scripts across my VM's. The creator of this script is actually  [omeinusch](https://gist.github.com/omeinusch). I found a Gist with this script in it. Some modification have been made to suit my needs, but the basic idea is still there.
